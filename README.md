<h1>Movies and Tv Series search Website</h1>
<p>This project is proposed as the homepage of a website for movies and tv series search.</br>
<p>
  To implement the project I used an <b>AJAX</b> call with <b>API keys</b> from www.themoviedb.org.</p>

<p>Using the search bar and entering the name, or part of the name, of a movie or TV series,  all the related results will be shown divided into two columns</p>.

  <p>Hovering each card, details of the movie or tv series are shown, including: language, rating and plot.</p></br>
  <p> Moreover, scrolling at the bottom of the card and clicking on the CAST button, a tab will be open showing photos and names of the main actors.</p>
